The Indian sub-continent is shown too\nsmall, whereas in contrast Southeast Asia is beginning to be depicted somewhat\ncorrectly.

It is not lawful there to buy and sell, except you buy\nspices and silk.

The\nsoil of this country, bringeth forth nothing but nutmegs, &amp; a few other\nfruits. The stalk or body of the nutmeg tree, is not much unlike the stalk of a\npeach tree, bringing forth like branches and leaves, but somewhat narrower.\nBefore these nuts be ripe, the mace creepeth on the tree, like a flourishing rose.\nAnd when the nutmeg waxeth\nripe, the mace embraces it round about. And so they gather both together in commune, at\na time appointed: for they use no distribution thereof, but he that gathered\nmost, hath most. This tree bringeth forth his fruit plentifully without any art\nof husbandry or tillage. They are gathered at such time as we gather chestnuts\n[October]. </p>"}}], "zoomify": {"attribution": "",
